This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug involving an invalid or unexpected selector. The bug.css file contains the erroneous CSS, while bugSolution.css provides the corrected code. The issue arises from a selector that either doesn't exist in the HTML or has a typographical error, preventing styles from being applied correctly.  The solution involves carefully reviewing and correcting the selector to match the HTML structure precisely.
